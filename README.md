| Multithreaded Matrix & Complex Arithmetic Library (C++ / Linux) |
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  - This repository contains a numerical computing library in modern C++ that performs matrix arithmetic with full complex-number support. The implementation focuses on:
  - Deterministic and transparent computation
  - Manual multithreading using std::thread
  - Linux-first development and build processes
  - Reusable template-based design without external dependencies

It is designed to be small, understandable, and useful for learning and experimentation with high-performance C++ arithmetic.

--------------
| Capability |
--------------
- Matrix addition / subtraction	✔
- Matrix multiplication	✔
- Scalar multiplication	✔
- Complex-number arithmetic (a + ib)	✔
- Support for real & complex matrix types	✔
- Multithreaded computation	✔
- Header-only matrix operations	✔
- Lightweight Linux build via Makefile	✔


For a complete working example of how to use the library, see `main.cpp`, which demonstrates complex-valued matrix multiplication from start to finish.
